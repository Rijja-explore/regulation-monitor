PCI DSS v4.0 - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data

3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.

3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.

3.2.1 Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes.

Primary Account Number (PAN) must not be stored or transmitted in plaintext in logs, support tickets, customer communications, or any unencrypted format. When PAN must be displayed, render unreadable through masking (showing only the first six and last four digits is acceptable).

3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.

Card Verification Value (CVV, CVV2, CVC) must not be stored under any circumstances after transaction authorization. This includes storage in logs, databases, support systems, or backup media.

3.4 Primary Account Number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.

PAN must be rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored (including portable digital media, backup media, in logs) by using one of the following approaches:
- Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures
- Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN)
- Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)
- Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes

Requirement 4: Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks

4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are defined and documented.

4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography whenever it is transmitted or sent via end user messaging technologies.

Never send unprotected PANs by end-user messaging technologies (e.g., e-mail, instant messaging, SMS, chat). Implement strong cryptography for transmission and display (e.g., TLS, SFTP, end-to-end encryption).

Requirement 8: Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components

8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed.

8.2.1 User password/passphrase must meet minimum length of 7 characters (or 12 for system/application passwords) and contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.

8.3 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for all access to the cardholder data environment (CDE).

Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data

10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity.

All access to cardholder data must be logged with user identification, type of event, date and time, success or failure indication. Logs must not contain full PAN or sensitive authentication data.

10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.

Requirement 12: Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs

12.1 A comprehensive information security policy is established, published, maintained, and disseminated to all personnel.

12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated annually.

Security policies must be reviewed at least annually and updated as needed to reflect changes to business objectives or the risk environment.

(1) Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject ('lawfulness, fairness and transparency');
(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes ('purpose limitation');
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimisation');
(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date ('accuracy');
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ('storage limitation');

Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary. Data retention policies must be implemented and enforced.

CHAPTER III - RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT

Article 17 - Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten')

(1) The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay.

Individuals have the right to request deletion of their personal information. Organizations must have processes in place to honor such requests within one month.

CHAPTER IV - CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR

Article 25 - Data protection by design and by default

(1) The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed.

Privacy-by-design principles must be implemented: data minimization, pseudonymization, encryption, and access controls must be default configurations.

Article 32 - Security of processing

(1) The controller and processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including:
(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems;
(c) regular testing, assessing and evaluating effectiveness of security measures.

Personal data must be encrypted in transit and at rest. Access controls must be implemented. Regular security assessments are required.

Article 33 - Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority

(1) In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority.

Personal data breaches must be reported to the supervisory authority within 72 hours. Notification must include nature of breach, categories of data, likely consequences, and measures taken.

Article 35 - Data protection impact assessment

(1) Where a type of processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall carry out an assessment of the impact of the processing operations on the protection of personal data.

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) must be conducted for high-risk processing activities involving sensitive data or systematic monitoring.
